            <p>Our content recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log

                information
                (like gender or race) to you. We have a Help article that explains how our content recommendations
                system works - spoilers:<br> the biggest driver of these recommendations is what you actually choose to
                watch through our service. You can read the article at netflix.com/recommendations.</p>

                <li>Service Providers: We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform
                    services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of<br> services to you. For example, we engage
