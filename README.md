Crafting the Netflix-themed web pages was a fulfilling experience, blending creativity with technical prowess. I enjoyed curating a personalized space for users, ensuring a seamless journey through the latest movies and TV shows, accompanied by reviews and recommendations.
All the icons inside the Netflix pages created myself.
